    <td>I was learning quite fast with these exercises because these, to me, were very useful. They weren't hard and they weren’t easy, they were just right for getting it right and learning along with it to. Especially the Battleships one.
For Battleships, some of the questions didn’t really make sense so I had to look at it more carefully and/ or ask a friend what to do, but in the end I really feel like I have learned something from these questions.
Strategies that helped me were the obvious hint buttons and asking a friend, but another one was reading carefully so I understand it fully and well.

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>There were a few things that limited my learning, one of which being the fact that python is hard and I cannot understand it fully - yet - but another is how slow I am at coding, I am fast at typing but I can't seem to code as fast.
My only habits I need to work on are the things I have already said, getting faster and/ or typing faster, I feel like I will improve on these habits soon, hopefully sooner rather than later.

    <td>For next time I will try to code faster because I am very slow, python is complicated, yes, but it can be enjoyable, teach you things and hopefully I will get faster.
