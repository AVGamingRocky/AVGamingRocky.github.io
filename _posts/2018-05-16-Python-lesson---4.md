  <tr>
    <td>
For strategies I was mostly failing a lot on lesson 3, but in lesson 4 I was flying through it because it was just a lot of true and false questions, not really coding. So my biggest strategy was trial and error because I am horrible at python. Luckily - as I said - it was pretty easy for lesson 4.
I learnt a lot in lesson 3 as well because there was a lot of coding - especially towards the end. </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
As I said, I am horrible at python and not a fast typer, the typing has improved because I have been typing a lot lately because I want to get better but the python itself hasn't gotten better.
I tried to do some python whilst I was ill but I was bedridden and couldn’t do it anyway because I was too ill.
The fact that I haven’t done any not on the thursdays in the lesson is limiting my learning because I am really bad at python.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
I will change how I learn, I will try to do other things - not just copying from the to do list - and I will try not to ask my neighbor to help me.
I will only improve my learning by doing more in the lesson and then carrying onto doing some in my own time as well, I believe that those two thing will make sure that I am not complete and utter trash when it comes to python.</td>
