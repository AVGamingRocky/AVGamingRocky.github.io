    <td>I learnt by trial and error as most of my answers were not right first try, but the only thing that made it effective was reading through the instructions carefully and read them again if I did not understand them first time round, then do as the question says and if not right use a hint which are very useful.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning was my lack of knowledge on python, it is quite easy but from someone who plays games and doesn't make them I was quite confused sometimes I might need to work on how fast I actually complete the exercises as I have only done one and that took me a lesson and a half.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will change how fast I work, I need to work faster and more effectively because if I want to do well in python I have to understand everything and (as I said) I have only done one exercise.</td>
