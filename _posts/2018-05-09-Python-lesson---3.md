  <tr>
    <td>I learnt with the instructions, trial and error and the occasional google if I was really stumped. It ended out fine in the end as I completed section 2 and got to section 3, even though it took a while, and (as I said) I used the instructions, trial and error and the occasional google for my strategies.</td>

    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The biggest two things that limited my learning are the fact that I can type at a moderate pace but I cannot read fast at all - I am a slow reader and that is one of my habits I need to work on, I shall try to improve my typing but I do not know if this will effect it as CodeCademy is 35% typing and the other 65% is basically reading/ working it out in your head.</td>

  <tr>
    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will change how I type and read and I will improve my learning by re-reading the instructions so I fully understand and I will look at the hints and/ or google if I really have to.</td>
