  <tr>
    <td>
It was all quite hard and overwhelming as I was ill when I was doing the exercise so I didn't understand it all that well but I got through it with my bad knowledge of Python, Iâ€™m an amatuer.
My strategies were non-existent at that point in time, I was getting things wrong (especially on section 5).</td>

    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
What limited my learning the most is the fact I was ill and it was hard to concentrate on my work when I was coughing and sneezing for the most part of it.
To be honest the only habit I needed to work on then was concentration - not on my illness - on my work.

    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>

  <tr>
    <td>
Hopefully I will change the fact that I am in school instead of being ill at home and this will also improve my learning because I only need to concentrate on one thing, Python.</td>
