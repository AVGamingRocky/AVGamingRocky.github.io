I was learning quite fast with these exercises because these, to me, were very useful. They weren't hard and they weren’t easy, they were just right for getting it right and learning along with it to.
For exercise 6, some of the questions didn’t really make sense so I had to look at it more carefully and/ or ask a friend what to do, but in the end I really feel like I have learned something from these exercises.
Strategies that helped me were the obvious hint buttons and asking a friend, but another one was reading carefully so I understand it fully and well. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>    
There were a few things that limited my learning, one of which being the fact that python is hard and I cannot understand it fully - yet - but another is how complicated it quite is because you can muddle up your code and/ or type it onto the wrong lines and I did that quite a lot but, as I said, it all made sense in the end.
My only habits I need to work on are the things I have already said, muddling up my code and/ or typing it onto the wrong lines, I feel like I will improve on these habits soon, hopefully sooner rather than later.</td>

For next time I will change my point of view, python is complicated, yes, but it can be enjoyable, teach you things and hopefully I will not muddle up my code and I will try to improve my learning by improving on my habits.
