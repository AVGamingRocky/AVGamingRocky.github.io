  <tr>
    <td>
As I said in my last post lesson 7 made me learn stuff, have fun and be more efficient at python, and lesson 8 was the same.
The most effective strategy was not listening to anyone else, looking down and doing my own work.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
I don't really think that anything limited my learning apart from the fact that I am a born procrastinator and if I stop to think about what to do my mind will wander all the way to France and eat a baguette.
This is probably my habit I need to work on as well.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

    <td>
For next time I will try to not procrastinate as much and hopefully this will improve my learning as well.</td>
