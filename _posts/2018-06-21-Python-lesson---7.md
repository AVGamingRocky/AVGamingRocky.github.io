I am not going to lie, this lesson (lesson 7) was probably the best one yet, it put you in a real life situation and you could implement your own spin on the coding and make it your own and that made it really fun and it kind of sucked you in to the code like you are really there and - as I said - it makes it fun to learn about coding in this sort of situation so I was concentrating on it really hard and I only had to use a hint once.
The best strategy I used was being in the moment and concentrating hard, all in all, I made good progress, I had some fun and I learnt quite a bit of stuff about Python.</td>

    <td>
I really can't say that anything limited my learning, but if I have to say something I belive it was the last section of lesson 7, I was coding and when I pressed run it said I was wrong, I did not understand it at all so I re - coded it and it still was not right so I had to use a hint and I got it right on my fourth try and again that limited my learning because, even though I was flying through this lesson, I still feel like I am still an amatuer at Python and I belive that that is my only habit I need to work on as well.</td>

    <td>
Hopefully, for next time, I will have a good time like I did for lesson 7 and if I don’t I will try to change my attitude towards it because it cannot always be easy or fun, sometimes you just have to grit your teeth and bear it because it can’t always be sunshine, lollipops and rainbows.
This will also improve my learning because I will change my attitude towards Python and, hopefully, it will improve my learning.</td>
